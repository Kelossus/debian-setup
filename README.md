# debian-setup
The initial setup of a fresh debian installation to get all the programs and packages that are required to work comfortably

This project is intended for a personal use, but if anyone finds the scripts useful, please, do not hesitate and use them.   
The first script installs ansible and runs the playbook on local mode, if you are too lazy to do it.

### The list of things I want installed:
* sudo, put user in sudoers
* Ansible (by bash)
* vim
* python3, pip3 and packages
* python2, pip2 and packages
* Neo4j
* pycharm
*
